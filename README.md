## üöÄ Quick Start

### Using as GitHub Package (Recommended)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/your-workflow.yml
name: Use Shared Workflow
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  python-ci:
    uses: chaunceyyann/cyan-actions@v1.0.0
    with:
      workflow: reusable-python-ci
      inputs: |
        {
          "python-version": "3.11",
          "run-integration-tests": true,
          "test-directory": "tests",
          "requirements-file": "requirements.txt"
        }

  changed-files:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: chaunceyyann/cyan-actions@v1.0.0
        with:
          action: changed-files
          inputs: |
            {
              "pattern": ".*\\.py$"
            }
```

### Using Direct References (Legacy)

```yaml
# .github/workflows/your-workflow.yml
name: Use Shared Workflow
on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  python-ci:
    uses: chaunceyyann/cyan-actions/.github/workflows/reusable-python-ci.yml@main
    with:
      python-version: '3.11'
      run-integration-tests: true
```

### Using Custom Actions

```yaml
# In your workflow steps
- name: Find changed files
  uses: chaunceyyann/cyan-actions/.github/actions/changed-files@main
  with:
    pattern: ".*\\.py$"
```

## üß™ Testing

This repository includes comprehensive testing for all custom actions and workflows:

- **Unit Tests**: Test individual functions and components
- **Integration Tests**: Test complete workflows and actions
- **Automated CI**: Tests run on every PR and push

See [.github/workflows/test-custom-actions.yml](.github/workflows/test-custom-actions.yml) for details.

## üì¶ Publishing Releases

To publish a new version:

1. **Create and push a tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag v1.0.0
   git push origin v1.0.0
   ```

2. **The publish workflow will automatically:**
   - Create a GitHub release
   - Publish to GitHub Packages
   - Make the version available to other repos

3. **Other repos can then use:**
   ```yaml
   uses: chaunceyyann/cyan-actions@v1.0.0
   ```
